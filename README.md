# Form validation - JavaScript Only

![Screenshot form validation](./form-validation.png)

## The Form

This form is simple. It uses JavaScript only to check the inputs. Will appear error messages when the user submits with:

- Empty values
- Invalid email
- Incomplete or Invalid CPF (a Brasilian social security number)
- Incomplete phone number
- Both passwords inputs with different values

In addition, I used **regex** to format the CPF and also the Brasilian phone number. CPF is formatted as `123.123.123-12`. The Brasillian phone number can be a landline of a cellphone. For landline is `(32) 3333-3333`. For cellphone is `(32) 99999-9999`.

If everything is correct, the user will be able to click on submit. The code will only display the data on _console_ and show an _alert_ saying that the data was submitted. On a real world project, here is where the data should go to a database. However, this simple project focuses on the front-end only.
	

## Technologies used

I wanted to let this code simple as possible. So I only used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You can see the app running using the link above, near description.
